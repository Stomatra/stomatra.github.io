        <h2>前言</h2>
        <p>
            今天晚上我闲来无事，看了一下<a href="https://genderdysphoria.fyi/zh/">性别烦躁指南</a>，发现了许多与我经历相似的情况，里面的内容让我感到非常共鸣。
            在里面发现一个关于<a href="https://medium.com/gender-from-the-trenches/gender-dysphoria-isnt-what-you-think-6fdc7ae3ac85">性别焦虑症</a>的内容，发现里面的内容真的很真实很真实，因此我把这些内容作为有关gd的第二部分，希望能帮助更多人理解性别焦虑症，帮助到更多的跨性别的孩子们。

            Cassie’s Incomplete List of Things That Were Actually Gender Dysphoria The Whole Time!<br />
            卡西的「这些原来全是性别焦虑症！」不完全清单！
        </h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I really loved singing, and it was always my favorite activity in music class. Then puberty hit, and I didn’t like singing anymore. My voice sounded awful, and I sort of wanted to take lessons to help fix it, but the idea of actually doing that was deeply distressing.<br />
                    我真的很喜欢唱歌，这始终是音乐课上我最钟爱的活动。然而青春期来临后，我便不再喜欢唱歌了。我的嗓音听起来糟糕透顶，我曾想过要上课矫正，但真要付诸实践却让我倍感煎熬。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I disliked my name, as well as all nicknames and diminutives.<br />
                    我讨厌自己的本名，也讨厌所有昵称和小名。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I was externally motivated. Everybody seemed to see me as a passionate person — first about film-making, and then about writing — but I didn’t really feel driven by any deep, innate sense of desire. Instead, I did these things in part because I liked being seen as as an artist, in part because I didn’t have a better idea of what to do with myself, and in part because I didn’t want to let people down.<br />
                    我的动力都来自外界。在旁人眼中我似乎是个充满热忱的人——先是痴迷电影制作，后来又投身写作——但实际上我从未感受到内心深处的原始渴望在驱动着我。之所以做这些，部分是因为享受被视作艺术家的感觉，部分是因为不知该如何安放自我，还有部分是不愿让人失望。
                </li>
                <li>
                    Being seen as aggressive was very distressing to me. Aggression is coded male in my mind, and I didn’t want anyone to think of me as an aggressive (male) person. This aversion to aggression made it nearly impossible for me to set healthy boundaries with people.<br />
                    被视作具有攻击性会让我非常困扰。在我认知里攻击性被贴上了男性标签，我不希望任何人把我看作具有攻击性的（男性化）形象。这种对攻击性的排斥，让我几乎无法与人建立健康的界限。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I had a deep and unwavering sense that I was going to die young. And I was so disconnected from my body, I assumed that all mysterious aches and pains were, like, a heart attack or something.<br />
                    我曾深信不疑自己会英年早逝。由于与身体严重脱节，我总把各种莫名的疼痛都当成心脏病发作之类的征兆。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I could never really imagine a happy future as myself. All of my plans involved some sort of vague transformation into a totally different version of myself. They were like, “I’ll do X, and then Y, and then Z, and then I’ll magically be the sort of person who is happy and successful!” But I couldn’t really picture that person, and I didn’t even really know if I actually wanted to be him.<br />
                    我始终无法真正想象以真实自我获得幸福的未来。所有人生计划都包含着某种模糊的蜕变——变成完全不同的自己。那些计划总是“先完成 X，再实现 Y，接着达到 Z，然后我就能奇迹般成为快乐成功的人！”但我根本勾勒不出那个人的模样，甚至不确定是否真的想成为他。
                </li>
                <li>
                    My body felt like a meat suit that begrudgingly carried me around from thing to thing. It was definitely not ME. Physicality of any kind felt like a burden.<br />
                    我的身体就像一具不情不愿拖着我去应付各种事务的肉体外壳。那绝对不是我。任何形式的肉体存在都让人感到负担。
                </li>
                <li>
                    The concept of vanity was alien to me. I was self-centered often enough, sure, but it had nothing to do with my body. My body wasn’t really me.<br />
                    虚荣这个概念对我来说极为陌生。虽然我确实经常以自我为中心，但这与我的身体毫无关系。这副躯壳并非真实的我。
                </li>
                <li>
                    Feeling disembodied seemed like an enlightened position to have. After all, I was free of the vanity and focus on physicality that plagued so many people, which enabled me to focus on improving my mind — the REAL thing that mattered.<br />
                    感觉脱离肉身似乎是一种开悟的境界。毕竟，我摆脱了困扰许多人的虚荣和对形体的执着，这让我能专注于提升心智——这才是真正重要的东西。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I felt lonely all the time, even when I was with friends and family. I figured I was just depressed, because I knew that I loved them and they loved me. The loneliness would abate sometimes, but it was hovering over me more often than not.<br />
                    我始终感到孤独，即使与亲友相伴时也不例外。我以为这只是抑郁使然，因为我清楚自己爱着他们，他们也爱着我。这种孤独感偶尔会减轻，但绝大多数时候都如影随形地笼罩着我。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I actively daydreamed about becoming someone else. Not anyone specific, but just…becoming another person. When that idle fantasy came up in discussion with cis friends, they couldn’t really comprehend the appeal of that sort of fantasy.<br />
                    我时常主动幻想着成为另一个人。并非特指某个具体对象，而是单纯地...变成另一个存在。当我把这种闲来无事的幻想说给顺性别的朋友听时，他们完全无法理解这种幻想的吸引力何在。
                </li>
                <li class="blue">
                    I didn’t think I was trans, but if someone had come up to me and said, “you’re not fooling anyone — you’re supposed to be a girl,” I would have been incredibly excited to hear that.<br />
                    虽然我不认为自己跨性别，但若当时有人对我说“你骗不了任何人——你本该是个女孩”，听到这句话我定会欣喜若狂。
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cultivating a personal style? That was A Thing For Other People. The idea of focusing on my body at all was deeply troubling, so I just wore the most comfortable clothes I could buy online. Hoodies, baggy jeans, etc. All male fashion styles really bothered me, but I couldn’t tell you why.<br />
                    培养个人风格？那是别人的事。光是关注自己的身体就让我深感不安，所以我只穿在网上能买到的最舒适的衣服——连帽衫、宽松牛仔裤等等。所有男性时尚风格都让我困扰，但我说不清原因。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I had no interest in most classically masculine pursuits, especially when it came to roughhousing and violent self-expression, but I liked just enough male-coded things — watching baseball, hanging out at the local game store, etc. — to fool myself into thinking I was just, like, one of those sensitive modern “soft boys.”<br />
                    我对大多数传统男性活动毫无兴趣，尤其是肢体冲撞和暴力宣泄类的活动。不过我还是喜欢够多的男性标签活动——看棒球赛、泡本地游戏店等等——足以自我欺骗，认为自己就像那些敏感的现代"温柔系男孩"。
                </li>
                <li>
                    Being in male-only or male-dominated spaces made me feel on edge. There was always a sense of being an interloper; of trying to speak phrases in a language that I didn’t really understand in order to gain acceptance. I lived in fear of those moments when “the other guys” would cock their heads at one of my responses before shrugging their shoulders and moving on.<br />
                    身处纯男性或男性主导的空间总让我如坐针毡。始终有种闯入者的错觉，仿佛在说着自己都不理解的语言以求被接纳。每当"其他男生"对我的回答歪头表示不解，随后耸耸肩转移话题时，这种时刻总让我活在恐惧中。
                </li>
                <li>
                    That moment in a group of male friends where The Last Girl Leaves The Room made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.<br />
                    当男性朋友聚会中"最后一个女生离开房间"的瞬间，总会让我颈后汗毛倒竖。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I felt a deep and contradictory need to prove myself to groups of men whose opinions I wouldn’t have given two shits about in any other context. In my case, it was in a fantasy baseball league with a bunch of old Orange County retirees. I know other trans women who have joined the military in sort of an extreme last-ditch attempt to make hyper-masculinity work.<br />
                    我内心有一种深刻而矛盾的需求，总想向某些男性群体证明自己——换作其他场合，我根本不会在意这些人的看法。就拿我来说，当时是在一个梦幻棒球联盟里，和一帮橘郡的老退休球员混在一起。我认识的其他跨性别女性中，有人甚至选择参军，试图通过这种极端方式做最后一搏，来适应极度阳刚的环境。
                </li>
                <li>
                    My approach to and experiences with sex and intimacy didn’t seem to match that of my male friends. It didn’t mean that I was any less horny — testosterone is REAL good at making you horny — but I was different in some weird fundamental way and I knew it. I was constantly terrified that my girlfriends would leave me for “a real man” since what I wanted was wrong and different, somehow.<br />
                    我在性和亲密关系方面的态度和经历，似乎总是和男性朋友们格格不入。这倒不是说我的欲望比他们弱——睾酮素在催生欲望方面可是实打实的高手——而是我在某些根本层面上显得古怪而异样，我自己心知肚明。我总在害怕女友会因为"想要个真男人"而离开我，毕竟我的渴求既反常又与众不同。
                </li>
                <li>
                    None of my deepest sexual fantasies involved being me, and they definitely didn’t involve being male. These fantasies were my deepest secrets from age 12 onward, and I told no one.<br />
                    我内心深处最隐秘的性幻想从来不曾以真实自我为主体，更与男性身份毫无关联。这些幻想自十二岁起便成为我最深的秘密，我从未向任何人吐露。
                </li>
                <li>
                    It just seemed like women were right most of the time. Whenever I watched a sitcom or listened to a stand-up set in the “men do X, women do Y” vein, I innately sided with and identified with the women before chiding myself for being so silly and reminding myself that I was a guy whether I liked it or not.<br />
                    似乎女性在大多数时候都是对的。每当我观看情景喜剧或听那种"男人做 X，女人做 Y"类型的单口相声时，我本能地就会站在女性一边并产生认同感，然后又会责备自己太可笑，提醒自己不管喜不喜欢，我都是个男性。
                </li>
                <li>
                    Eventually, this line of thinking broadened into becoming Just A Really Good Ally.<br />
                    最终，这种思维方式逐渐扩展，让我成为了"一个真正的好盟友"。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I became certain that I was gay the moment I started hearing about gay people in whispers and rumors. Then I learned that being gay meant I had to like boys, and I DEFINITELY didn’t like boys, so I dropped the whole thing for 25 years or so.<br />
                    当我第一次从窃窃私语和流言中听说同性恋这个词时，我就确信自己是同性恋。但后来我了解到，身为同性恋意味着必须喜欢男生，而我绝对不喜欢男生，于是我把这个念头搁置了大概二十五年。
                </li>
                <li>
                    Later on, in college, people started calling me “a lesbian in a guy’s body.” This comparison really tickled me, and I leaned into it pretty hard, especially when it came to playing Lilith Fair style music for my friends.<br />
                    后来上大学时，人们开始称我为"住在男人身体里的女同性恋"。这个比喻让我觉得特别有意思，我也很乐意接受这个说法，尤其是当我给朋友们播放莉莉丝音乐节风格的歌曲时。
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most of my friends were queer, and I always felt connected to the queer community even though I didn’t think I actually belonged there myself. I justified it as, “people who are forced to re-evaluate their identities instead of just blindly accepting what they’re given are just more interesting people in general.”<br />
                    我的朋友们大多是酷儿，虽然我不觉得自己真正属于那个群体，但始终感到与酷儿社群有着某种联结。我这样安慰自己："那些被迫重新审视自我身份、而非盲目接受既定标签的人，往往都更有趣。"
                </li>
                <li>
                    People kept telling me that I was angry — and I was — but I didn’t FEEL angry. I just felt anxious all the time. The anger is so clear in retrospect, but at the time I just had an incredibly low tolerance for life in general. Sometimes even just the act of going to the coffee shop in the morning left me paralyzed.<br />
                    人们总说我充满愤怒——确实如此——但我自己并未感受到愤怒。我只是终日被焦虑笼罩。如今回想起来愤怒如此鲜明，可当时只是对生活的容忍度低得可怜。有时甚至仅仅是清晨去咖啡店这样简单的举动，都会让我陷入动弹不得的窘境。
                </li>
                <li class="blue">
                    Occasionally I’d glimpse myself in the mirror and experience a pang of confusion and revulsion, especially when I wore formal things like suits and ties. I assumed it was because I was overweight, and all fat people hate their bodies, right? That’s what TV taught me, at least.<br />
                    偶尔瞥见镜中的自己，我会突然感到一阵困惑与嫌恶，尤其当我穿着西装打领带这类正式装扮时。我将其归咎于体重超标，毕竟所有胖人都讨厌自己的身体对吧？至少电视是这么教我的。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I felt a deep longing to experience femininity, but I couldn’t bring myself to wear a dress or put on makeup or anything because that was way too scary and thinking about my body was so distressing. Instead, I tried to experience femininity vicariously through my partners. That ended up with me in a lot of deeply codependent relationships, as well as being irrationally upset if they wanted to cut their hair, present more masc, etc.<br />
                    我深切渴望体验女性特质，却始终不敢穿上连衣裙或化妆——这些举动太过骇人，光是想到自己的身体就令人窒息。于是转而通过伴侣来间接感受女性气质，结果陷入多段深度共生关系，每当对方想剪短发或展现阳刚气质时，我都会莫名恐慌。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I was willing to admit that if you could swap genders at will, I’d definitely spend SOME time as a woman. You know, just to see what it would be like. I wasn’t willing to admit the giddy feeling that idea gave me.<br />
                    我承认若真能随心切换性别，自己肯定会以女性身份生活一段时间——纯粹想体验不同人生。但始终不愿正视这个念头带给我的雀跃悸动。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I always had one foot in the past and one foot in the future. Being in the present moment was kind of intolerable. Mindfulness exercises always seemed to involve forging some sort of connection with the body, and that was a non-starter for me, so I figured that mindfulness was basically just a scam.<br />
                    我的生活总是半截扎在过往，半截探向未来。全然活在当下简直难以忍受。那些正念练习总要求人与身体建立联结，这对我而言根本无从谈起，以致我曾坚信所谓正念不过是场骗局。
                </li>
                <li>
                    Speaking of exercise, I didn’t do any. I could very occasionally lather myself up into a blind panic over my weight and lifestyle, and then I’d go out and run until I collapsed or whatever, but any sort of regular fitness routine just caused me to feel embodied in extremely painful ways, both physically and psychically. So I just got fatter and sadder, for years.<br />
                    说到锻炼，我其实根本没做。偶尔我会因为体重和生活方式陷入盲目的恐慌，然后冲出去跑到虚脱为止，但任何规律的健身计划都会让我在身心两方面痛苦地感受到这具躯体的存在。于是年复一年，我只是变得越来越胖，越来越忧郁。
                </li>
                <li>
                    When I wasn’t daydreaming or planning, I immersed myself in movies, TV, video games, card games, books, comics, writing projects, etc. I needed to escape into entertainment on a pretty constant basis.<br />
                    当我不做白日梦或不制定计划时，我就沉浸在电影、电视剧、电子游戏、卡牌游戏、书籍、漫画、写作项目等等之中。我几乎需要持续不断地躲进娱乐世界里。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I didn’t want to write stories about people “like me” (cishet white guys) because those narratives all seemed boring. But I was always so scared of saying the wrong thing that I didn’t feel comfortable writing about women and queer people, either. I usually ended up splitting the difference somehow.<br />
                    我不想写关于"像我这样的人"（顺性别直男白人的故事，因为这类叙事似乎都很无聊。但我又总是害怕说错话，所以写女性和酷儿群体时也觉得不自在。最后我通常总会采取某种折中的方式。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I didn’t feel like an interloper or an anthropologist in female-dominated spaces — that was just how normal people communicated, after all — but I did feel terrible whenever any the women in those spaces referenced the fact that I was unlike them in some way. It wasn’t like I knew she was wrong — I still thought of myself as a man, after all — but I wished I could have what they had.<br />
                    在女性主导的空间里，我并未觉得自己是闯入者或人类学家——毕竟那只是普通人的正常交流方式——但每当那些空间里的女性提及我在某些方面与她们不同时，我都会感到极度难受。倒不是我认为她们说得不对（毕竟我仍视自己为男性），而是我渴望能拥有她们所拥有的一切。
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most of my strongest friendships were with women, but I constantly lamented how much longer it took women to start trusting me (while understanding exactly why) and that there was always some level of intimacy missing from our friendships. In some cases, this led me to confusing my desire to be best friends with a girl with a desire to date her.<br />
                    我最深厚的友谊大多是与女性建立的，但我始终遗憾于女性需要更长时间才会开始信任我（虽然完全理解其中缘由），且我们的友情总是欠缺某种程度的亲密感。有些时候，这让我错把想和某个女孩成为挚友的渴望，当成了想和她谈恋爱的冲动。
                </li>
                <li>
                    I didn’t like being tall. I told myself I liked being tall because society privileges tallness, and I definitely liked being able to see the stage at concerts, but I would have way rather been smaller and cuter.<br />
                    我不喜欢自己长得高。虽然常自我安慰说高个子受社会优待，也确实享受能在音乐会看清舞台的便利，但内心深处我宁愿自己娇小可爱些。
                </li>

                    If you’d offered me the chance to press a button and become an attractive cis woman — and I didn’t have to explain myself to my friends and family and employers because that’s who I would have always been to them —I would have felt a thousand million butterflies in my stomach and I would have agonized over it for hours and then at about 2 AM I would have pressed it so fucking hard.<br />
                    如果有人给我一个机会，按下按钮就能变成一位迷人的顺性别女性——而且我无需向亲友、雇主解释任何事，因为在他们的认知里我从来就是如此——那一刻我定会心如擂鼓，在辗转反侧中煎熬数小时，直到凌晨两点狠狠砸下那个按钮。
